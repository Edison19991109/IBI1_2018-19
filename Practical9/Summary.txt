The results of running the python file show that BLOSUM score for mouse human comparison is 1091,
but for mouse random sequence comparison and human random sequence comparison are both -250.
Considering sequence length may also influences BLOSUM score, normalised scores are calculated through dividing BlOSUM score by sequence length.
The normalised score for mouse human comparison is 4.91, while for mouse random sequence comparison and human random sequence comparsion the scores are both -1.12.
In addition, 89.6% amino acids in mouse and human sequence are the same, whilst only 5.4% amino acids are the same comparing mouse or human sequence with random sequence.
These results suggest that mouse and human SOD2 proteins are very similar in sequence.
Surprisingly, when compared random sequence with human or mouse sequence,  scores are both the same negative interger.
So next time when we want to show how similar between two different sequences by using BLOSUM score, it may be better to provide a baseline like the BLOSUM score of comparing those sequences with a random sequence.
