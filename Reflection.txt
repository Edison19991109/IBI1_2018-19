This practical is full of fun. I like it so much!
Well, at first, getting to know how to use GitKraken is a little bit difficult, but with the help of Yuxing and Mela, I am ultimately become more familiar with it.
I went through some difficulies in this practical, like cannot verifying when creating an account. But Mela is so great! She helped me to work out what the problem is.
So teamwork and try to getting help from others is vital for our future work. I think that is the technique we should practical more in the following days.
There seems nothing more I still confuse with. Almost done. Time for lunch. Hahaha
